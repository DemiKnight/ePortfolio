                        <p>
                            In this topic, we learn the building blocks of the web, both the client and server side technologies and how they all interact with one another to create the websites we use every day.
                            The technologies we will learn include: HTML, CSS, JavaScript and PHP.

                        <h3>My Learning</h3>
                        <p>
                            Having already learn and used HTML/CSS/JS prior to university, and used it with personal projects and the work place.
                            It has been refreshing to use web languages without any frameworks/libraries.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Previously, I would have used tools such as
                            <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/" target="_blank">Bootstrap</a>,
                            <a href="https://reactjs.org/" target="_blank">ReactJS</a>,
                            <a href="https://redux.js.org/" target="_blank">Redux</a> and
                            <a href="https://webpack.js.org/" target="_blank">Webpack</a> to aid in developing and publishing the webpage.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            In the future, I look forward to working with Javascript; as this is the main language I would in conjunction with a library/framework.
                            By using no additional frameworks, I hope to make my normal Javascript in other projects more efficient.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            This unit covers analysing a pre-existing system in an organisation, designing a new system (often based on the former analysis) and finally creating one.
                            We will be creating the new system using <a href="https://www.oracle.com/database/technologies/appdev/sql-developer.html" target="_blank">SQL</a>.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            As well as improving our system analysis, designing and creation skills.
                            We will also be improving our written and presentation skills, as they are both incorporated into the project.
                        </p>

                        <h3>My Learning</h3>
                        <p>
                            In this unit so far, we have learnt about Software Development Lifecycles and how they can make or break software, also the various pro’s and con’s of popular methodologies.
                            Learning about various management techniques and how strategies are created, has helped me understand how to properly analyse a pre-existing system.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            All of this is completely new to me and has been fascinating to learn about. Not only for my degree but also for possibility of starting up my own business.
                            Since the beginning of the unit, I forced my group to use a online planning tool called <a href="https://trello.com" target="_blank">Trello</a> to organise all our work
