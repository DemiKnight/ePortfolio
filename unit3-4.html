                    This unit teaches both the logic and mathematical side of computing.
                    In separate classes, we will be building and understanding logic gates, and how groups combined can create the processing units in every computer.
                    In the maths classes, we will be taunt various techniques that directly apply to various situations in programming.

                <h3>My Learning</h3>
                <p>
                    We have learnt about basic logic gates (such as AND, OR, NOT, XOR, NAND,NOR, XNAND) and how they can go onto form complex circuits (such as an Adder, Decoder and even a 1 bit logic/arithmetic unit).
                    We have used Truth Tables and a program called <a href="http://www.cburch.com/logisim/">LogiSim</a> (though I have found it’s successor called <a href="https://github.com/reds-heig/logisim-evolution">Logisim Evolution</a>).
                </p>
                <p>
                    In the maths side of things, we have been learning Sets, which is another work for Arrays in my mind.
                    We have learnt how to use them in Venn diagram, and how to calculate total’s about a certain population in these sets.
                    Next we will be moving onto matrices.

                    This unit involves us learning the programming language Java.
                    Not just the syntax but the key concepts the drive software and how we can use those concepts in our own programs to make them easier to develop and more efficient.

                <h3>My Learning</h3>
                <p>
                    I have already work with Java in the past, as well as C++, which has given me a pretty good knowledge of the language and its uses.
                    I have also taught Java through the use of Minecraft Mods to kids under 16, which given me a good understanding of OOP and other concepts.
                    Because of this, I have yet to learn anything new but have enjoyed being refreshed on topics we have covered in lectures.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Thus far have learnt the fundamentals of the Processing framework, and it has been very interesting to think about how these basic principles/statements could be used to build more complex graphics.
                    I have already began learning as much as I can on the Processing reference.
                    And building a basic application which has a logic side and Processing side, both of which talk to each other and could produce game-like graphics.
