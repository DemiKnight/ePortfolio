                    <h2>Critical Thinking and Problem Solving</h2>
                    <section>
                        <p>
                            Problem-solving is most predominant in my software development.
                            Whether it is an assignment or personal project, I always try and pick the correct tool and use it effectively as possible to achieve the required result.
                            For Example, I used C++ for an application that was heavy on data manipulation for the speed and React for a website that emphasises responsiveness and interaction.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Critical Thinking is visible in most things I do, whether it is in my assignments or worth ethic.
                            I always try and improve what I have previously made, even if it has received positive feedback.
                            I do this to improve myself and any projects and stay ahead of the competition.
                        </p>

                    <h2>Professionalism</h2>
                    <section>
                        <p>
                            I have worked for my college in the past, creating a parent portal from scratch and making it fit the college's style.
                            This was my first professional job as a web developer, and it taught me how to create a website for a strict specification.
                            It also taught me how to act within a development team and the workflow involved.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I have had two jobs in the catering industry which have both required interactions with the public.
                            In both positions, I needed to maintain a professional demeanour to represent the company accurately.
                            In the future, I would like more experience working in a professional environment to get me used to the standards involved.
                        </p>

                    <h2>Communication Skills</h2>
                    <section>
                        <p>
                            I have been employed in the catering industry twice, Costa and McDonald's, both of which has required me to communicate effectively and professionally to customers and colleagues.
                            Without this communication, I would not be able to function on a given station and fall behind.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I have also been employed as a software developer, which required me to convey my intentions/decisions for a task to the rest of the team to make sure it meets the required specification.
                            I did this effectively enough for all my code to be used in the full deployment of the website.
                        </p>

                    <h2>Teamwork and Leadership</h2>
                    <section>
                        <p>
                            I have been involved with multiple hackathons and often lead my team, not always to victory but to a finished, usable product.
                            I have had 2 jobs (McDonald's and Costa), both of which can be quite intense at times.
                            Both positions require me to work as a team to provide excellent service to customers and keep a calm environment.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I sometimes do lack the confidence to speak up about a matter regarding my commitment.
                            For example, a project that would require me to dedicate time to it.
                            I will try and speak up for myself in the future.
                        </p>

                    <h2>Learning and Research Skills</h2>
                    <section>
                        <p>
                            In the sense of researching in the hopes of finding something or an understanding that is entirely new is alien to me.
                            However, researching a topic and finding any useful resources or techniques is something I have done quite a lot of in the past; particularly when starting a new project.
                            I would often try to complete a task in an unnecessarily complicated fashion, in the hopes of picking up a new skill.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            For example, using C++ & Electron (Node.JS) for my coursework when most used VB.
                            Or using React + Redux to build a website instead of something like Wordpress which would have been easier.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            To improve I will try and gather more information on a process before attempting to use it within an app, to evaluate whether it is useful in the first place.
                        </p>
